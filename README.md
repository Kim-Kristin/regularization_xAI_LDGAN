Precondition:
Windows users can follow the official microsoft tutorial to install python, git and vscode here:

- ​​https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/beginners
- german: https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/python/beginners

## Visual Studio Code

This repository is optimized for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is a great code editor for many languages like Python and Javascript. The [introduction videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos) explain how to work with VS Code. The [Python tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) provides an introduction about common topics like code editing, linting, debugging and testing in Python. There is also a section about [Python virtual environments](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments) which you will need in development. There is also a [Data Science](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/overview) section showing how to work with Jupyter Notebooks and common Machine Learning libraries.

The `.vscode` directory contains configurations for useful extensions like [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens0) and [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). When opening the repository, VS Code will open a prompt to install the recommended extensions.

## Development Setup

Open the [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) and run the setup script for your OS (see below). This will install a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) with all packages specified in `requirements.txt`.

### Linux and Mac Users

1. run the setup script: `./setup.sh` or `sh setup.sh`
2. activate the python environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. run example code: `python src/hello.py`
4. install new dependency: `pip install sklearn`
5. save current installed dependencies back to requirements.txt: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

### Windows Users

1. run the setup script `.\setup.ps1`
2. activate the python environment: `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
3. run example code: `python src/hello.py`
4. install new dependency: `pip install sklearn`
5. save current installed dependencies back to requirements.txt: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

Troubleshooting:

- If your system does not allow to run powershell scripts, try to set the execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`, see https://www.stanleyulili.com/powershell/solution-to-running-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system-error-on-powershell/
- If you still cannot run the setup.ps1 script, open it and copy all the commands step by step in your terminal and execute each step
